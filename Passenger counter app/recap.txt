getElementById("id")
innerText
textContent
textContent is a better solution than innerText.
textContent gets the content of all elements, including <script> and <style> elements. In contrast, innerText only shows "human-readable" elements.
textContent returns every element in the node. In contrast, innerText is aware of styling and won't return the text of "hidden" elements.
