all statements end with ; although it is not necessary
alert can be used only in the browser developer tools.

alert("Hello"); will give an alert on the window saying Hello with an OK button
alert(); will give an alert with whatever value in the parenthesis with an OK button
can take multiple strings by using + 

Data types: string, number, boolean

typeof(); to know the data type of something

prompt(); similar to alert but takes user input, with an OK button
alert(prompt("Type something")); will give the input as alert.

var variable_name = value; for declaring a variable  

var name = prompt("What is your name?");
input = Sarthak
Now the value of name becomes 'Sarthak'.

Naming Conventions for js variables = abc123$_   only.

string concatenation -> a + " " + b will give a b.
can be used in alert and prompt functions.

string a -> a.length; will give the length of the string a.

commenting in js is same as c/c++.

string slicing -> a.slice(start_index, end_index+1); index starts with 0.
a.toUpperCase() and a.toLowerCase() for changing casing of a string.
a.slice(start, end).toUpperCase(); also works.

number operations = + - * / % same as c/c++, with same priority order.
incrementing and decrementing expressions are same as c/c++ i.e., i++, i--, i+=2, i*=2, etc.
post and pre incrementing and decrementing is also same.

function name(parameters, if any){
    statements;
}
calling a function -> name();

instead of alert(), we can use console.log(), difference is that with alert any visiter can see the alert but with console.log only the developer can see the alert.

function name(any parameters){}

Math.floor(value) will give a rounded off value.
Math.round(value) does the same but is more efficient.

to make a function that returns a value:
function name(parameters, if any){
    *data*
    return value or variable or function;
}
var result = name(value, if any);

Math.pow(base, exponent); to get a number raised to a power.
